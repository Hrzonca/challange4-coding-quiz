Project: Coding Anatomy Quiz Using Web APIs
Description
My site is suppose to be a timed quiz that counts down after you press the start button and a question appears. 

I am having trouble connecting the questions and the options in some way that will appear on screen. Also, i cant figure out how to get the timer to count down.

Due to a chaotic week, it is not complete yet but I wanted to turn in something on the due date. I will be trying to complete it tomorrow.
